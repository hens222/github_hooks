I solved almost all the tasks in the assessment. 
The backend is built with python 
The UI is built with simple HTML

In the video, you can see that I worked with the ec2 machine of aws. I added a code to make a screenshot of the PR page but it didn't work correctly in the ec2.
I tried some more libraries. At the end of the video you can see that in the local host, the screenshot worked. 
The UI is built with simple HTML because I wanted to focus more on the backend than frontend (there is a start of using react in the project)

The database is SQLite but I wanted to connect the project to the RDS database, PostgreSQL in AWS for example. 


in order to activate the project locally 

do git clone 

then type the command - pip install -r requirements.txt
